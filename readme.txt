Show your support for The Save Ferris Project!  Adds a diagonal banner to the upper right hand corner of any Wordpress website, and links to The Save Ferris Project.  When clicked it opens in a new tab, so you don't loose you're readers - your window is still open when they come back.  

Based on the St. George Day corner ribbon by Steven Nobel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What is The Save Ferris Project?

You can find out the whole scoop at http://www.TheSaveFerrisProject.com, but the short of it is:  My friend "Ferris" ends up drawing a bad lot in life - lost his job, lost his health, but has four kids and a wife to contribute to - and I'm stepping in to help him get retrained and move to a field he can work in.
